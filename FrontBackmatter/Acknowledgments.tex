\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank all my masters. In semi-chronological order: Gabriella Beretta, Cristina Forlano, Elisabetta Mauri, Maria Galbiati, Simone Mortara, Silvia Monti, Haim Cipriani, Ugo Volli, Maria Grazia Barzaghi, Alessandra Airoldi. I would like to thank my parents, together with my whole family. I would like to thank my friends, Gondor, lab61, my course mates, all the comrades. I cannot fail to explicitly mention Claudio (Proposition~\ref{proposition:claudio} is yours). I would like to thank Maria Chiara. I am thankful to all of you. This thesis would not exist without Ugo Dal Lago, who trusted me from our first meeting and Matteo Pradella, who has always been available. A lot of people in Politecnico di Milano inspired me in these five years. It would be unfair making a list because someone would stay out of it. I would like to thank two professors beyond the sea. Silvio Micali, who first introduced me to theoretical computer science with an amazing talk when I was a freshman, and Scott Aaronson, who did the rest with \emph{Quantum Computing since Democritus} and \emph{Shtetl-Optimized}.
